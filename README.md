# Fix sodium ShaderLoader
 
There is some time I made [a PR](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3132) to fix nvidium and voxy to being able to load shaders in sodium, it have been merge and it have been sometime. Because sodium 0.6.14 is not released yet, I made this mod to patch sodium 0.6.13 to have the same fix.
